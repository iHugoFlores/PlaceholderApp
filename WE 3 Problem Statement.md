# Weekend 3 Assignment
## Due: Apr 9, 2020


## Placeholder App

Attached is a problem statement provided that has been shown off previously in class.

Please implement a solution with the following additional requirements:

* MVVM structure
* Host your submission on any Git-service (we like GitHub)

In addition, provide any 2 of the following:

* a message appearing if the user was unable to download the data, along with a prompt and means to retry downloading.
* some animations upon user-interaction before moving into the details screen.
* offline persistence, saving images and/or the data, along with some indication to the user that the data was cached and an ability to re-download the data.
* panning on the details screen, as the full-sized image is actually much larger than the screens of some devices, allowing a user to fully view the entire image.
* split up the items within the table and collection into different sections, based on their albumId.
* have some means to hide/show albums by their albumId.
* fancy, different UI for each type of album, based on albumId.
* some other fun, non-trivial feature (or two of them, if you have other ideas)
